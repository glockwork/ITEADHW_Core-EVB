ITEADHW-Core-EVB
================

Core EVB is a customized evaluation board for ITEAD Core AW204x, which pinouts the functional pins of AW204x to the corresponding physical interface such as USB ports, SD card slot Ethernet port etc. Moreover, Core EVB provides a 40 pins interface that is compatible with RPI B+, which will help developers utilize the existing Add-on more easily.

Common A20 development boards in the market only provide Line-in/Line-out interface so that they can't drive a loudspeaker directly. However, we add power amplifier so that it can drive 4ohm or 8ohm speaker easily.
